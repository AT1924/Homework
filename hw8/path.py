    Purpose: Determine the shortest path in the graph from v_start v_to_find.
    The method should return a list consisting of the shortest path from
    v_start to v_to_find. The first element of the returned list should
    be v_start and the last should be v_to_find. If there is no path
    between the start and end vertices, return an empty list.
    Example: path.shortest_path(g, v_start, v_to_find) -> [v_start, v1, v2, v_to_find]
    Throws: InvalidInputException if any input is None or either vertex
    is not in g.
